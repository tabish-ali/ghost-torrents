                <p>The Ghost Torrents is the torrent scraper using Bittorrent protocol.
                    Bittorrent is a filesharing protocol that in a reliable way enables big and fast file transfers.
                    No torrent files are saved at the server.
                    That means no copyrighted and/or illegal material are stored by us.
                    It is therefore not possible to hold the people behind the Ghost Torrents responsible
                    for the material that is being spread using the site.</p>
                <br>
                <p> The site is run privately. That means that we do not guarantee that the site will be
