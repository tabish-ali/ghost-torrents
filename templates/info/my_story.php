                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>I am simple guy try to bring good to world. I graduated in <b class="text-primary">Computer Engineering
                    </b> in 2019 but things are not gone as expected. As you know we live in world where
                    now a days getting help is luxury epsecially in the time of this penademic.
                    I graduated my degree was mixture of some what Electrical and Computer so i dont know what
                    to do with it. Only thing I knew was <b class="text-success">Programming</b> , so i learned what I to get
                    things going.</p>
                <br>
                <p>So I find hard getting job with no connections and refrence or hight profile.
                    Many Software companies rejected me because they look at my degree and there is also
                    <b>Electrical</b> term mention in it. Job is just a became mystery bug in my life
                    which I was unable to resolve.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Let me tell you a joke. I am kinda shy person who don't ask many questions to
                    people but one day I dare to ask about how people got their first job because I have read
                    some where on internet that <b class="text-danger">85%</b> jobs are never <b class="text-info">advertised</b>
                    and given on the basis of <b class="text-warning">references</b>.
                    So you were wondering what was people replies on that post. The thing is no body
                    <b class="text-danger">leaved a comment</b>.(Funny &#128514;)</p>
                <br>
                <p>I started free lancing projects, it did not went well. At beginning I was betrayed
                    and did not get my share from projects I developed but thats not problem this is life
                    and it happens. So we need to accept that we are not that good. Some of us are just average.</p>
                <br>
                <p>So there are few of us who were standing alone, never get any help from any body.
                    You know why God don't send help to some people? Becasue he knew that this guy can do it
                    himself he ain't needing nobody. So if you're standing alone it means you're strong
                    and you can make it alone yourself. You need no body. But remember if you reach at some
                    point where you can help others, be kind and help them and because you remembers your suffering, how it
                    feels to stand alone.</p>
                <br>
                <p>So I was dreaming every day about developing torrent site. It's hard
                    you need to understand bittorrent protocol but this is simple. It is just like
                    torrent scraper. I am some how converting torrent files or hash into magnet links and
                    extracting info from them.</p>

                <br>
                <p>I just came to know couple of things about programming and started this site.
                    Hopefully I will imporve it and try to put useful content in it.</p>
